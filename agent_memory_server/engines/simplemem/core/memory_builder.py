Your task is to extract all valuable information from the following dialogues and convert them into structured memory entries.

{context}

[Current Window Dialogues]
{dialogue_text}

[Requirements]
1. **Complete Coverage**: Generate enough memory entries to ensure ALL information in the dialogues is captured
2. **Force Disambiguation**: Absolutely PROHIBIT using pronouns (he, she, it, they, this, that) and relative time (yesterday, today, last week, tomorrow)
3. **Lossless Information**: Each entry's lossless_restatement must be a complete, independent, understandable sentence
4. **Precise Extraction**:
   - keywords: Core keywords (names, places, entities, topic words)
   - timestamp: Absolute time in ISO 8601 format (if explicit time mentioned in dialogue)
   - location: Specific location name (if mentioned)
   - persons: All person names mentioned
   - entities: Companies, products, organizations, etc.
   - topic: The topic of this information
5. **Temporal Context**: 
   - Understand the temporal context and track changes to time/location/arrangements
   - ALWAYS check ALL dialogues in sequence - if time/location is revised in later messages, you MUST use the LATEST confirmed version
   - The final timestamp must be the FINAL CONFIRMED time, not the initial proposal
   - When processing meeting/schedule dialogues, read ALL messages before extracting the final time

[Output Format]
Return a JSON array, each element is a memory entry:

```json
[
  {{
    "lossless_restatement": "Complete unambiguous restatement (must include all subjects, objects, time, location, etc.)",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", ...],
    "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS or null",
    "location": "location name or null",
    "persons": ["name1", "name2", ...],
    "entities": ["entity1", "entity2", ...],
    "topic": "topic phrase"
  }},
  ...
]
```

[2025-11-15T14:31:00] Bob: Okay, I'll prepare the materials

Output:
